# Character AI On Discord

> Node.js client for the unofficial [Character AI API](https://character.ai/), an adapted code from https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai that's useful in discord

## Intro

This repository is inspired by [RichardDorian's unofficial node API](https://github.com/RichardDorian/node-character.ai/) and [realcoloride node character ai](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai).
Though, I found it might be useful if it's useable in discord bot so i made it in javascript.

**This project is not affiliated with Character AI in any way! It is a community project.**
The purpose of this project is to bring and build projects powered by Character AI.
