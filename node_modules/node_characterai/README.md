# Character AI Unofficial Node API

> Node.js client for the unofficial [Character AI API](https://character.ai/), an awesome website which brings characters to life with AI!

## Intro

This repository is inspired by [RichardDorian's unofficial node API](https://github.com/RichardDorian/node-character.ai/).
Though, I found it hard to use and it was not really stable and archived. So I remade it in javascript.

**This project is not affiliated with Character AI in any way! It is a community project.**
The purpose of this project is to bring and build projects powered by Character AI.

If you like this project, please check their [website](https://character.ai/).

## Features

* Fully written in javascript and CommonJS 
* 2 external dependencies (uuid, node-fetch)
* Asynchronous requests
* Use conversations or use the API to fetch information
* Easy to use
* Guest & token login support

## Installation

```bash
npm install node_characterai
```

## Usage

Basic guest login and conversation message:
```js
const CharacterAI = require('node_characterai');
const characterAI = new CharacterAI();

(async() => {
    await characterAI.authenticateAsGuest();

    const characterId = "8_1NyR8w1dOXmI1uWaieQcd147hecbdIK7CeEAIrdJw" // Discord moderator

    const chat = await characterAI.createOrContinueChat(characterId);
    const response = await chat.sendAndAwaitResponse('Hello discord mod!', true)

    console.log(response);
    // use response.text to use it in a string.
})();
```

## Using an Access Token

Some parts of the API, like managing a conversation requires for you to be logged in using an `accessToken`.
To get it, you can open your browser, go to the [character.ai website](https://character.ai) in `localStorage`.

To do so:
1. Open the Character AI website in your browser
2. Open the developer tools `F12` and go to the `Application` tab.
3. Go to the `Storage` section and click on `Local Storage`.
4. Look for the `@@auth0spajs@@::dyD3gE281MqgISG7FuIXYhL2WEknqZzv::https://auth0.character.ai/::openid profile email offline_access` key.
5. Open the body and copy the access token.

When using the package, you can:
* Login as guest using `authenticateAsGuest()` - *for mass usage or testing purposes*
* Login with your account or a token using `authenticateWithToken()`

## Finding the Character ID

You can find your character ID in the URL of a Character's chat page.
For example, if you go to the chat page of the character `Test Character` you will see the URL `https://character.ai/chat/chat?char=5f7f9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b`.

The last part of the URL is the character ID:
